# Measurement Transducer GUI

This repository contains a Python script that implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for converting various measurements. The GUI is built using the `tkinter` library and allows users to easily convert between miles and kilometers, as well as between kilograms and pounds. The user inputs the value in one unit, clicks the appropriate conversion button, and the converted value is displayed.

## Key Features

- Intuitive interface for quick measurement conversion.
- Accurate rounding of converted values for better precision.
- Organized layout with labeled inputs, buttons, and result labels.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the repository directory.
4. Run the `measurement_transducer_gui.py` script using Python.
5. Use the GUI to input values and perform conversions.
